## Mobility Management
**Design**
  
1. Chassis
We design the chassis using Autodesk Inventor and printed
it with 3D printer to create customised car that suit our
need for a vehicle that can house various sensor within it
without the restriction that can be seen in vehicle made
from lego parts or EV3

2. Concept
We incorporate the steering ackerman to make the car turn without the tire slipping
when turning corners

3. Motor(s)
We use a single TT Motor to provide because of the power that it can
generate. We put the motor in the middle of the vehicle and connected
it to a differentian made from lego to provide power to the two back-wheel
and avoid unnecessary waste of space. Our vehicle use a single servo at the
front bridge to turn the front wheel.

## Power and Sense Management
We incorporate 4 ultrasonic sensors at each side of the vehicle to give the vehicle the
ability to detect walls that surround it and for it to be able to correct it's distance
to the wall so that it doesn't come into contact with it. We also have 1 camera at the
front of the vehicle to detect the various pillas and the colors of thoes pillars. The
vehicle is powered by 2 li-on battery. the information from the various sensors are 
directed to a raspberry pi to process and then we have an arduino to control the motors
