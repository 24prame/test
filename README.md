# Mobility Management
**Design**
  
1. Chassis
We design the chassis using Autodesk Inventor and printed
it with 3D printer to create customised car that suit our
need for a vehicle that can house various sensor within it
without the restriction that can be seen in vehicle made
from lego parts or EV3

2. Concept
We incorporate the steering ackerman to make the car turn without the tire slipping
when turning corners

3. Motor(s)
We use a single TT Motor to provide because of the power that it can
generate. We put the motor in the middle of the vehicle and connected
it to a differentian made from lego to provide power to the two back-wheel
and avoid unnecessary waste of space.
